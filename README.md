#About

This repository contains all the projects I had completed in teh Udacity Nanodegree - Programming for Data Science with Python.

##SQL Project

This was the first project I had completed in the nanodegree program. It required me to perfectly apply the concepts of subqueries, Joins and Advanced SQL.

##Python Project

This project required me to apply python, numpy and pandas concepts on a real world data Analysis problem. It really helped me a lot to work upon and improve my skills further.

##Version Control Project

This project required me to learn and apply how to work with Git and Github, and required me to apply various important concepts of git like merging, branchhing and working with local and remote repositories.
